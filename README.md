# Exercism Bash Solutions Backup

This repository stores my solved exercises from the [Exercism Bash track](https://exercism.org/tracks/bash).  
It acts as a personal backup and progress log for shell scripting practice.

## Structure
- Each folder corresponds to a specific exercise.
- Files inside contain my solutions and related scripts.

## Purpose
- Keep a safe, version-controlled backup of my Bash solutions.
- Track learning progress and revisit exercises when needed.
- Reference point for future scripting projects.

## Note
These solutions reflect my current understanding of Bash.  
They may not always represent the most optimal or idiomatic approach.
